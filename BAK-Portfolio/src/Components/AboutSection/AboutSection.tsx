        <h2>Who I Am</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Brett Kuhn, a software engineer who specializes in front end development and a recent graduate of 
          Turing School of Software and Design. I'm passionate about building applications and solving complex 
          problems, and I find great joy in new experiences and learning new things, both inside and outside of the 
          tech industry. Working as a part of a team is important to me, and I take pride in building a strong
          culture and fostering collaboration. When I'm not coding, you can find me traveling, rock climbing, playing
          music or building guitars.
          <br />
          Talk about career transition here...? 
          After nearly a decade in the oil and gast industry..
